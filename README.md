# jiratree
A small tampermonkey userscript for the use in jira.
It shows a treewidget with all child issues of a selected issue in the dashboard.

Please notice:
This userscript does not work with greasemonkey anymore. Since version 4 (/firefox 57) changed the way userscripts are run and this way is not backwards compatible. So please switch to either tampermonkey or violentmonkey.
